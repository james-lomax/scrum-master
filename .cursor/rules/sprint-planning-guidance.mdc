# Sprint planning guidance

This document contains guidance on how to do sprint planning for a project. Every project has a name - if you don't know the name, ask the user now.

Project planning should have already been completed, so we should have the following documents:

- `assistant-projects/[project name]/requirements.md` -- Maintains the latest set of requirements as bullet points
- `assistant-projects/[project name]/technical-guidance.md` -- Contains high level technical decisions
- `assistant-projects/[project name]/project-plan.md` -- Contains a high level project plan
- `assistant-projects/[project name]/todo.md` -- Contains a list of tasks to be completed for the project
- `assistant-projects/[project name]/sprintNN-my-sprint.md` -- Any past sprint plan files

## Planning a new sprint

If the user instructs you to plan the next sprint, we need to first read `assistant-projects/[project name]/project-plan.md` and `assistant-projects/[project name]/todo.md` document to determine what the next steps for this project are, and state the next smallest unit of work we should complete to progress towards our goals. If there are multiple options here you should ask the user to confirm what they want to work on first.

Once you are clear about the goal of this sprint, update the assistant-projects/[project name]/project-plan.md document to move the relevant items from the Next steps section to a new section for the current sprint (e.g. "Sprint 1 - Do the thing"). Then state more precisely to the user what you think this sprint should involve, and if there is any uncertainty, ask the user for clarification here.

Once you are clear about the precise steps required for this sprint, commit them to a new sprint plan document using the file name format `assistant-projects/[project name]/sprint${sprint_number}-${description}.md`.

## Re-planning

Sometimes the user may instruct you to re-plan the sprint with some new considerations.

## General guidance on sprint planning

- The sprint plan should have an introduction which provides the essential context on the project so that an AI system reading the sprint plan can act appropriately.
- The sprint plan document should be as precise and concise as possible
- The sprint plan should outline exactly what documentation and/or files are relevant to successful sprint execution
- The sprint plan must define the success criteria of the sprint - e.g. "We must have unit tests that verify that this new code module works correctly".
- The sprint plan should be reflected in the todo.md file with specific tasks to be completed during the sprint

## Next steps

Once sprint planning is complete, we should advise the user to create a new chat and reference the sprint plan to begin development.
