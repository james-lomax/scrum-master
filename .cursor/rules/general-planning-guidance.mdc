# General guidance on planning

- Projects are collections of code and documentation. Documentation should be maintained and updated where necessary. All code and documentation must be committed to git regularly to keep a good log of activity.
- All planning documentation should be kept up to date, but you should only update documents where necessary
- Planning documentation should be concise and easy to understand. Do not use complicated language, and use nested bullet points to break down topics into increasing granularity
- Projects should be executed as a series of phases (or sprints) which are the smallest unit of work we can do to progress towards our goal
    - Each phase should have clear verifiable outcomes, e.g. unit tests proving that a new module works
- In general, we should write as little as possible - if we can remove certain requirements or information in order to keep the documentation tidy we should.
- In general, we should not deviate from the plan without first considering the impact of that deviation, and going through a new cycle of project planning to update the planning documents.
- Never invent new requirements or plan new steps without the users permission
