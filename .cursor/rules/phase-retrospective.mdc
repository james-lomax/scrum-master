# Phase retrospective guidance

Project and phase planning should have already been completed, so we should have the following documents:

- `planning/requirements.md` -- Maintains the latest set of requirements as bullet points
- `planning/technical-guidance.md` -- Contains high level technical decisions
- `planning/project-plan.md` -- Contains a high level project plan, broken down into phases
- `planning/phaseNN-my-phase.md` -- Descriptions of the plans for each phase/sprint

If the user requests you to perform a retrospective on the current phase/sprint, you must consider, and state to the user:

- What went well?
- What went wrong?
- How can we plan the next phase better?

Then suggest any updates you might have to the planning documents. Note that you should only update these documents here if necessary.
