# 🤖 Scrum Master AI

they tried to automate devs, so we automated them first 🔄 uno reverse card ✨

## what is this?
a set of AI prompts that do everything a scrum master does:
- plan your project ✨
- run your standups 🌅
- manage your sprints 🏃‍♂️
- do retros 🔄

## how to use
1. clone this repo
2. open [Cursor](https://cursor.sh) (it's giving VSCode but better)
3. type `@kickoff-project.md` in compose mode
4. watch the AI do its thing

## pro tips 👀
- review the planning docs before yolo-ing into prod
- AI's giving project manager vibes, not tech lead energy - so stay on top of that code review bestie
- delete this README when starting your project (the AI gets salty)

## bestie you'll need
- Cursor editor w/ agent mode
- vibes
- coffee probably

## no but actually
this is real. it works. your scrum master is typing...
